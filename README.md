# A sentiment analysis project by Patrik
This project demonstrates my skills in developing a full stack application with TBD languages. Will edit this afterwards. Or not, dunno.

## Setup 
### Step 1: Run the API Docker image
After building the image, the next step is to run it in a container. Run the following command in the project root folder to start up the API container: \
`docker-compose -f "compose-dev.yaml" up`

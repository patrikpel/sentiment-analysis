# A sentiment analysis project by Patrik
This project demonstrates my skills in developing a full stack application with TBD languages. Will edit this afterwards. Or not, dunno.

## Setup 
### Step 1: Run the docker image
After cloning the repository, go to the root of the repository and run `docker build -t sentiment-analysis .` to create the docker image. You can subsitute a name of your own if you want, but remember to replace it in later steps.
